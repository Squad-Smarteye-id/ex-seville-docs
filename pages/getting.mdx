## Creating Starter Project

import Image from 'next/image'

<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center', alignItems: 'center' }}>
  <Image src="/docs2.png" alt="Hello" width={500} height={500} />
</div>

You can add a starter project by accessing the 'Add' menu in the Hierarchy. Then, select **`Menu Item Seville`** and choose the project you wish to create. Remember to remove the camera from the GameObject, as the starter scene already includes a character controller equipped with a camera.

## Adding Areas to Project VR 360

<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center', alignItems: 'center' }}>
  <Image src="/docs3.png" alt="Hello" width={500} height={500} />
</div>

To integrate a 360-degree photo asset into your scene, an Area Handler must manage all settings within that area. Area Handler can be added by clicking the Add New Area button in the Environment Manager component.

<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center', alignItems: 'center' }}>
  <Image src="/docs4.png" alt="Hello" width={500} height={500} />
</div>

Assign your photo to the specified area using the Area Texture variable. Additionally, various settings can be adjusted, such as restarting the scene upon exiting the room, which helps reset the area's configuration. The Cam Look Rotation feature allows for the positioning of the photo as the player enters the area. Moreover, in 'Env Area Handler' you can set a Backsound for this area. Lastly, click the Add Features button to add features to your area and select the desired features from the ‘Prefab Instantiator window’.

Creating Starter Project
You can add a starter project by accessing the 'Add' menu in the Hierarchy. Then, select **`Menu Item Seville`** and choose the project you wish to create. Remember to remove the camera from the GameObject, as the starter scene already includes a character controller equipped with a camera.

### Adding Areas to Project VR 360
To integrate a 360-degree photo asset into your scene, an Area Handler must manage all settings within that area. Area Handler can be added by clicking the Add New Area button in the Environment Manager component.
Assign your photo to the specified area using the **`Area Texture`** variable. Additionally, various settings can be adjusted, such as **`restarting the scene`** upon exiting the room, which helps reset the area's configuration. The **`Cam Look Rotation`** feature allows for the positioning of the photo as the player enters the area. Moreover, in '**Env Area Handler**' you can set a **`Backsound`** for this area. Lastly, click the **`Add Features`** button to add features to your area and select the desired features from the ‘Prefab Instantiator window’.

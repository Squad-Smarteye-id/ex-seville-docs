# Popup Canvas

- **Overview**: The ‘Popup Canvas’ is designed to display information in the form of photos and descriptive text.
- **Adding This Feature**: This feature can be added by clicking the ‘Add Features’ button located in the `**EnvAreaHandler**` (VR360) or `**EnvironmentAreaManagerVR3D**` (VR3D) component in the inspector, and then selecting the ‘Popup Canvas’ prefab.
- **Setup:**
    - You can insert various content items like photos and text through variables in the ‘Content Pop-up’ section.

<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center', alignItems: 'center' }}>
  <Image src="/features/popup.png" alt="Popup Canvas" width={700} height={700} />
</div>

    - By default, the image component is set to display photos with dimensions of 960 x 540. To modify this, adjust the width and height in the ‘Rect transform’ component of the child GameObject named ‘Target Image’.
    - To alter the UI appearance, first adjust the position of the ‘panel’ GameObject. Change the Y position value to 0 to view the panel after updating the display by inserting UI assets into the image component. Then revert to the original Y position, which is -1080.

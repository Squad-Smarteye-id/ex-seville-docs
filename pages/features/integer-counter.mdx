# Integer Counter

- **Overview**: The Integer Counters feature is a versatile component designed to manage integer values within Unity projects. It's particularly useful for tracking scores, resource counts, health points, or any numerical value that changes over time within a game or application. This feature is commonly utilized in gaming for scoring mechanisms, inventory management, health tracking in player characters or enemies, and other similar functionalities where numeric values need to be incremented or decremented based on game events.
- **Adding Features**: This feature can be added by clicking the ‘Add Features’ button located in the ‘EnvAreaHandler’ (VR360) or ‘EnvironmentAreaManagerVR3D’ (VR3D) component in the inspector, and then selecting the ‘(LOGIC) INTEGERS COUNTERS’ prefab.
- **Behaviour**:
    - **IncreaseValue(int amount):** This function allows for increasing the **`currentValue`** by a specified **`amount`**. If the **`valueMax`** has not been reached, the **`currentValue`** is incremented, and the UI is updated to reflect the new score. This is useful for adding points to a player's score or increasing the quantity of a resource.
    - **DecreaseValue(int amount):** Similar to **`IncreaseValue`**, this function decreases the **`currentValue`** by a specified **`amount`**, with the added check that the value does not drop below zero. It's useful for deducting points or resources, handling damage to a player's health, or any situation where the numeric value needs to be reduced.
    - **CheckScore():** This function checks whether the **`currentValue`** has reached or exceeded the **`valueMax`**, and if so, triggers the **`OnMaximalValue`** UnityEvent. This can be used to execute specific actions once the maximum value is reached, such as ending a game level, granting a reward, or triggering a special event.
    - **GetCurrentValue():** Returns the current value of the counter. This function is useful for querying the current score or value for display purposes, logic decisions, or further calculations within the game.
    - **UpdateValueText():** Updates the UI element (**`debugValueText`**) with the current score. This function ensures that the displayed value is always in sync with the **`currentValue`** of the counter, providing real-time feedback to the player.
    - **OnMaximalValue:** A UnityEvent that is invoked when the **`currentValue`** reaches or exceeds **`valueMax`**. This allows developers to easily attach custom responses, such as UI updates, gameplay changes, or other actions directly from the Unity Editor, enhancing the flexibility and interactivity of the game or application.
